    <h1><u>Tofu Recipe</u></h1>
    <h2><i><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/246936/simple-pan-fried-tofu/">Courtesy to The Cow on allrecipes</a></i></h2>
    <b>Ingredients</b>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Directions</b>
    <br>
    <u>Step 1</u>
    <br>
    Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3 to 5 pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid.
    <br>
    <u>Step 2</u>
    <br>
    Cut tofu into 2x4-inch strips about 1/4-inch thick.
    <br>
    <u>Step 3</u>
    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook tofu strips in the oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Stack tofu strips horizontally in a dish with sloping sides, like a teacup saucer.
    <br>
    <u>Step 4</u>
    Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet. Add green onions; cook and stir until fragrant, 10 to 20 seconds. Spoon green onions over tofu while they are still sizzling. Coat with soy sauce. Let sit until tofu soaks up flavors, 3 to 5 minutes.

    <b>Finished!</b>
